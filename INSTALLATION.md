#Installation

1. Obtain a version of Python at least 3.4+ from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. If the distribution of Python you are using does not contain the following libraries, download and install them independently:

      -math

      -time
      
      -random
      
      -socket
      
      -matplotlib
      
      -copy
      
3. Finally, download the Python files "NeuralNetwork.py", "ZombieSlayer(Neural Network).py", and "ResultsPlotter.py" if you want to use the Neural Network version of the game, or just download "Zombie Slayer(Single Player).py" if you want to try the human version of the game.
