  Hi! My name is Adam Quinn, and I'm excited to share with you this project, which I developed with my partner Natasha Thomas. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how a "Neural Network" can be evolved using a "Genetic Algorithm" to better complete a task---in this case playing a simple game called "Zombie Slayer." Below is an explanation of these technical terms, as well as attribution information and sample results. If you are already familiar with neural networks and genetic algorithms, feel free to go to "INSTALLATION.md" for information on how to setup this project or "USERGUIDE.md" for information on how to use it.
